// -------------------------------------------------------------------------//


1. Introduction

    The MyTeams protocol is a communication protocol that enables a
    client-server model for collaborative communication application
    like Microsoft Teams. This protocol is designed to facilitate the
    communication between the server and the client through a set of commands
    that allow users to create, join, and leave teams, create channels, threads,
    comments, and personal discussions.


// -------------------------------------------------------------------------//


2. Protocol Overview

    The MyTeams protocol is based on TCP sockets and follows a simple
    request-response model. The client sends a command to the server,
    which processes it and responds with the result. The commands are
    sent as text strings, and the responses also as string.


// -------------------------------------------------------------------------//


3. Protocol Specification

    3.1. Commands =>


    The MyTeams protocol supports the following commands:

    -   /help : List all available command or specific command details if command_name is provided
    -   /login [“user_name”] : set the user_name used by client
    -   /logout : disconnect the client from the server
    -   /users : get the list of all users that exist on the domain
    -   /user [“user_uuid”] : get details about the requested user
    -   /send [“user_uuid”] [“message_body”] : send a message to specific user
    -   /messages [“user_uuid”] : list all messages exchanged with the specified user
    -   /subscribe [“team_uuid”] : subscribe to the events of a team and its sub directories (enable reception of all events from a team)
    -   /subscribed ?[“team_uuid”] : list all subscribed teams or list all users subscribed to a team
    -   /unsubscribe [“team_uuid”] : unsubscribe from a team
    -   /use ?[“team_uuid”] ?[“channel_uuid”] ?[“thread_uuid”] : Sets the command context to a team/channel/thread


    The following commands are only available in a context: (team, channel, thread) or (team, channel) or (team) or (user) or (none) :

        -----> Should be used after the command /use

    -  /create : Based on the context, create the sub resource
    -  /list : Based on the context, list all the sub resources
    -  /info : Based on the context, display details of the current resource



    3.2. Responses =>


    The MyTeams protocol responses are in string format and have the following structure:

    [STATUS] [MESSAGE_DATA]



    3.3. Error handling =>


        In case of an error, the response data will contain the error message, like:

        [STATUS] [MESSAGE_DATA]


    STATUS: indicates if the command was successful or not.
    MESSAGE_DATA: contains the response data.



// -------------------------------------------------------------------------//


4. Security

    The MyTeams protocol doesn't have any password authentication,
    but it implements some basic security measures to prevent unauthorized
    access to data. For example, a user who is not logged in cannot see the
    connected users, and someone who is not subscribed to a team
    cannot create a thread.


// -------------------------------------------------------------------------//


5. Conclusion

    The MyTeams protocol is a simple and efficient communication protocol
    that allows users to collaborate in teams, channels, threads, and
    personal discussions. By following the guidelines outlined in this
    document, developers can create client and server applications that
    are compatible with this protocol.
