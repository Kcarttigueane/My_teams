# My Teams - Collaborative Communication Application

My Teams is a server and CLI client application designed to manage collaborative communication similar to Microsoft Teams. It follows a simple request-response model and uses TCP sockets for communication. The protocol supports a set of commands that facilitate various actions, such as logging in, sending messages, and creating teams, channels, threads, and comments.

| `/subscribe`  | `team_uuid`         | `string` | **Required**. Subscribe to the events of a team and its subdirectories (enable reception of all events from a team) |
| `/subscribed` | `?team_uuid`        | `string` | **Optionnal**. List all subscribed teams or list all users subscribed to a team |
| `/unsubscribe`| `team_uuid`         | `string` | **Required**. Unsubscribe from a team |
| `/use`        | `?team_uuid` `?channel_uuid` `?thread_uuid`     | `string` | **Required**. Sets the command context to a team/channel/thread |


The following commands are only available in a context: (team, channel, thread) or (team, channel) or (team) or (user) or (none):


|   Endpoints   | Description                       |
| :----------   | :-----------------------------    |

}
```


Error Handling

  <br/>
</p>


Security_Considerations
======================

- No password authentication is required for this project.
- A user that is not logged in should NOT be able to see connected users.
- Someone that is NOT subscribed to a team should not be able to create a thread.
- Someone that is NOT subscribed in a team should not receive events related to that team (new threads, etc.).

Built_With
==========

- C programming language
- TCP sockets for network communication
- Select system call for handling multiple clients
